# Introduction

Many debaters—especially in fast-paced debate—suffer from unclarity. This happens because they slur their words or stutter when trying to speak quickly, making one word sound like the other. To remedy this, debaters do speaking drills. However, most focus on speed, not clarity.
To improve clarity, we designed a wearable device that will shock the user once they become unclear or stutter. This will make it so that speech redoes and speaking drills will focus on fluidity and clarity.
